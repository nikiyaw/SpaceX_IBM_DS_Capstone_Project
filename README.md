# SpaceX_IBM_DS_Capstone_Project

###Introduction
SpaceX advertises Falcon9 rocket launches with a cost of 62 million dollars where other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each,
mostly because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. But there are times where the first stage does not land, or it will crash mid-flight, or even being sacrificed due to various mission parameters. 
In this project, we will determine the price of each launch by gathering information and training a machine learning model to predict if SpaceX will be able to reuse the first stage.
